# tessel-v2-hardware

KiCAD design files for Technical Machine's Tessel 2

## Notes

* We use the [daily builds of KiCAD](https://code.launchpad.net/~js-reynaud/+archive/ubuntu/ppa-kicad) and you should too! 
* You'll also want to download [TM's KiCAD library](https://github.com/technicalmachine/tm-kicad-library) to make sure you have all the schematic symbols and footprints.
* As a general rule, do not assume that schematic, layout, and manufacturig exports were kept abreast on each commit. Do a fresh export (or use tagged releases) if you intend to actually send off gerbers.
